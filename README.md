This repository gives an introduction about me as well as some mini scale projects.

## Index.html

This is my detailed CV. It contains more information than the pdf version.

## Compass

This is a mini-scale project that I build to share what I have learnt in compass and straightedge construction. I find this interesting and easy to learn,
so I hope to share the knowledge with others.
